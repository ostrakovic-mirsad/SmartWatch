# SmartWatch

## Introduction
The project was done under sponsorship of Storsen, for my bachelor thesis. The main goal was to design a brand new smartwatch, which would perfectly fit an average student use cases.

Requirements which will need to be meet are:
  - GUI competitive to that offered by the top of the market,
  - make the device customizable as much as possible, to offer the best possible user experience 
  - integrate BLE connectivity, to make device accessible by the outer world
  - implement advanced fitness and activity tracker
  - extend the device's battery life as long as possible
       
Everything on the project was done from scratch. Components were selected to be the best trade-off between low power consumption and performance. PCB was designed to occupy space as little as possible, to make the device more compact. Software was written without using any additional APIs like HAL or CMSIS.
